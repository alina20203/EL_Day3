## **Taks 3**: Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a  machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) through the data points that minimizes the difference between actual and predicted values.

# **Tasks Performed in the dataset**

## 1. Import and preprocess the dataset

The first step involves importing the dataset for initial exploration. Any missing or inconsistent data entries are handled appropriately, Categorical variables are encoded into numerical values,etc to ensure a clean and reliable dataset for model building.

## 2. Split data into train-test sets

After preprocessing, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. Typically, 70-80% of the data is used for training the model, while the remaining 20-30% is set aside for testing.

## 3. Linear regression model

In the next step, a Linear Regression model is created using the training dataset. The model is trained to learn the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).

## 4. Evaluate model

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the testing dataset. Predictions are made on the test data, and evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the R² score are calculated. 

## 5.Plot Regression line

Finally, the regression line is plotted alongside the actual data points to visualize the model’s performance.
